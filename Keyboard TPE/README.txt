To setup, get your twitch OAuth from
https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

Open cfg.py (should work with notepad)

replace the NICK and PASS values with your
twitch username and OAuth
(remember to put quotes around them)

Change up the Special Keys and Keybindings however you like

execute run.bat

 Help I messed up my cfg.py file
 and now nothing works!
===
Delete cfg.py
Create a copy of default.py, rename it to "cfg.py"
You're now back to default (you will need to redo setup)
